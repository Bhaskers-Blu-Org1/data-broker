C-Code Styleguide

  tbd.
  I know it's late anyway, but better late than never...



Doxygen Styleguide

 * Use the example type of comments to annotate.
   Every line should contain the *
   Align the first *

   /**
    *   put the doxygen text here
    */
    
   Use the @-style version of doxygen commands
    
    
* Regular documentation with brief and detailed description:
   /**
    * @brief This is the short description
    *        and you might do multiline
    *
    * The details follow after an empty line with just the aligned asterisk
    */
    
* Variables 
    For short descriptions of variables append to the end of a line:
      int myVar;   /**< description of myVar */
   
    For long description, use the regular block 


* Parameters, return values:

   /**
    * ...
    * @param [in]  myVarIn   description with multiline
    *                        text aligned like this one
    * @param [out] myVarOut  description of variable ...
    *
    * @return description of return value(s)
    */
    
    
* Grouping. Let's try to create document groups for the
  client lib and the system lib. Available groups (incomplete):
    api        - for anything in the client/user library
    be_common  - for anything generic to the back end
    be_redis   - for the Redis backend
    
  @defgroup/@addtogroup  to define/redefine groups
  @ingroup               to add an item to a group
