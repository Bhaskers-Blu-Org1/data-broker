/**
 * @brief Insert a scattered tuple in a namespace.
 *
 * The function allows the user to insert new data to a namespace.  This
 * requires a valid namespace handle, a tuple name and a list of pointers and
 * sizes to specify memory region containing the tuple elements to gather into the
 * tuple.
 *
 * The function is blocking and it will return when the tuple is stored in the namespace.
 * If there exists already a tuple with the same name, the current tuple data will be added to the namespace
 * in FIFO order.
 *
 * @param [in] dbr_handle   Handle to the namespace.
 * @param [in] va_ptr Pointer array to the tuple elements.
 * @param [in] size Size array of the tuple elements.
 * @param [in] len Number of entries in the va_ptr and size arrays
 * @param [in] tuple_name Name/key identifying the tuple.
 * @param [in] group Group to which the namespace belongs.
 *
 * @return
 *    - DBR_SUCCESS if the insertion is completed successfully;
 *    - DBR_ERR_TIMEOUT if the insertion does not complete before the timeout occurs;
 *    - An error code identifying the issue encountered, otherwise.
 *
 * @see DBR_Errorcode_t
