# data-broker
The Data Broker (DBR) is a distributed, in-memory container of key-value stores enabling applications in a workflow to exchange data through one or more shared namespaces. Thanks to a small set of primitives, applications in a workflow deployed in a (possibly) shared nothing distributed cluster, can easily share and exchange data and messages with a minimum effort. In- spired by the Linda coordination and communication model, the Data Broker provides a unified shared namespace to applications, which is independent from applicationsâ€™ programming and communication model.
